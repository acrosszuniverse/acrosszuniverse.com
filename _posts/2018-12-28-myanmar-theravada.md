Religion is central in the daily life of Burmese People (who should be called "Myanmar's inhabitants" for more accuracy and involvement of minor ethnic groups). Almost 90% of the population is Buddhist, applying Theravada principles with zeal through donations at the temple, Buddhist education as monks novices and daily prayers.

For those not familiar with this religion, Buddhism can be divided in three branches:

* Theravada = also called "Small Vehicle", it is the major belief in South East Asian countries, such Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand as well as in Sri Lanka.
* Mahayana = known as the "Greater Vehicle", it has a higher number of adepts than its smaller cousin and is practiced in India, China, Korea and Japan.
* Vajrayana = very close from the Mahayana, it includes some variations taken from the tantric Hinduism. Its disciples can be found in India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Mongolia.

All these branches acknowledge the existence of the historical Buddha as the father of Buddhism and master of enlightenment showing people the way toward nirvana through reincarnation cycles.

Theravada is considered more strict, showing a firmer application of the doctrine. Contrary to the Greater vehicle, I feel that its advocates (especially in Myanmar) are looking for a better "next life" by obtaining merits, mainly from money giving and offerings, rather than fulfilling their quest of the actual nirvana.

For those in want of more information, the Buddhist Society Organisation offers a clear explanation of this religion, its principles and beliefs: <https://www.thebuddhistsociety.org>
